<Layout title={pageTitle} description={pageDescription} pubDate={new Date()} showHeader={false}>
  <p>
    I am an automation and security engineer passionate about solving complex problems through engineering. I design and build secure, scalable solutions that streamline operations, reduce risk, and create long term technical value.
  </p>

  <p>
    My work focuses on infrastructure automation, security engineering, and building systems that reduce manual overhead while increasing reliability. I approach every project with a systems mindset, ensuring that solutions are not only functional, but maintainable, secure, and designed to scale.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have experience working across Linux and Windows environments, developing automation pipelines, deploying infrastructure, and integrating security controls directly into operational workflows. Whether it is patch management automation, domain enrichment pipelines, infrastructure as code, or custom tooling, I focus on building solutions that are practical and production ready.
  </p>

  <p>
    Security is foundational in everything I build. I prioritize strong authentication, clear architecture, proper access controls, and visibility through logging and monitoring from the start of every project.
  </p>

  <p>
    I enjoy turning complexity into clarity. The most rewarding projects for me are the ones that start fragmented and become structured, automated, and resilient through thoughtful engineering.
